# Playground 🎮  

Welcome to **Playground**! 🚀 This is my personal space for coding experiments, testing ideas, and working on fun projects. Whether it's a quick script, a new framework exploration, or just some random tech tinkering, you'll find it here.  

## What's the purpose?
🛠️ **Experiments** – Trying out new programming concepts, libraries, and frameworks.  
🎯 **Personal Projects** – Small and fun side projects just for the thrill of coding.  
🔬 **Prototypes & Testing** – Code snippets and test cases to explore different approaches.  

## What's Inside?  
- Currently there is a browser variation of **Tic Tac Toe** written in HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
  - You can select size of the grid from $3\times3$ and up to $10\times10$.
  - You can choose how many marks in a row player should put to win.

## Notes  
- Code quality may vary—some things work, some don’t. That’s the fun of it!  
- Feel free to browse, get inspired, or fork something cool.  
- No strict structure—this is an evolving and ever-changing space.  

Happy coding! 🚀
